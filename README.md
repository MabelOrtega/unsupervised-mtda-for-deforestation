# Unsupervised-multi-target-domain-adaptation-for-deforestation-detecttion

This code is an adaptation of the work``Unsupervised Multi-Target Domain Adaptation: An Information Theoretic Approach (MTDA-ITA)'' proposed by Gholami et al., originally designed for image classification tasks.  
We propose a fully convolutional architecture to exploit the spatial context in the image data and improve classification accuracy in the context of deforestation detection using pixel-wise classification.
